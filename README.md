## Event Schedule

### Training 1: Fundamentals of Embedded Systems
This training session will provide you with the foundational knowledge needed to understand embedded systems and how they work. We'll cover basic concepts, microcontrollers, and the software development environment.

### Workshop 1: IR Sensors
In this workshop, you will learn about infrared (IR) sensors and how to use them in robotics applications. You'll have the opportunity to build a project that utilizes IR sensors. The code is provided in IR_workshop1.

### Workshop 2: Ultrasonic Sensors
Explore the capabilities of ultrasonic sensors in this workshop. Learn how to measure distances, detect obstacles, and integrate ultrasonic sensors into your robotics projects. The code is provided in US_workshop2.

### Workshop 3: Motors and Motor Driver L298N
Understand the principles of DC motors and the L298N motor driver module. You'll gain hands-on experience in controlling motors and designing robot drive systems. The code is provided in l298n_workshop3.

### Workshop 4: Bluetooth Module for Remote-Controlled Robot
Build a remote-controlled robot using a Bluetooth module. Learn how to establish a wireless connection and control your robot using a smartphone. The code is provided in RC_workshop4.

### Training 2: Line Follower Robot Assembly
This training session will prepare you for assembling a line follower robot. You'll acquire the skills needed to construct a robot that can follow a line autonomously.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- Workshop presentation materials (slides, documents, code examples)
- Sample code for each workshop
- Additional resources and documentation
- Supplementary materials for training sessions

## Equipment Protection Guidelines

To ensure the safety and responsible use of the equipment provided during the workshops, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Handle Equipment with Care:** Treat all equipment, including sensors, motors, and controllers, with care and respect. Avoid dropping or mishandling them.

2. **No Food or Drinks:** Do not consume food or drinks near the workshop area or the equipment. Spills can damage the equipment and create safety hazards.

3. **Report Damage or Issues:** If you notice any damage or issues with the equipment, please inform the workshop's technical support team immediately. Do not attempt to repair or modify the equipment yourself.

5. **Follow Safety Instructions:** Pay attention to safety instructions provided during the workshops.
   
6. **Do Not Turn on Batteries Until Cabling is Checked:** For safety reasons, do not turn on the batteries until the cabling is checked by the technical support team.

8. **Respect Others:** Be considerate of your fellow participants. Share equipment and resources, and collaborate in a friendly and respectful manner.


We hope you enjoy the Robothon workshops and find them valuable for your robotics journey!

Happy coding and robot building!
